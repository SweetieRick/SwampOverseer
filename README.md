### About

Swamp Overseer is a Discord chatbot that uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to provide a powerful server management experience. Besides some features every other bot on the platform probably has, Swamp Overseer is hand crafted in order to excel in:

- **Robust commands**; _no more shitfuckery with in-built commands that no-one remembers_
- **Quality memes**; _auto-post from Reddit, video fetching from Neverthink and high level shitposting features_
- **No more cringe**; _Overseer has 2 sides: Fight twitter users | he forgor ðŸ’€_
- **Unique punishment system**; _unlike traditional bots that do all the boring "!warn" or "!mute", Overseer adds several new features to allow you to detect unwanted links, cringey behaviour, based language and possible unwanted visitors. We also have a prison setup, but discover my features as-you-go_

### How do I use the bot?

You can invite the bot right now by clicking [this invite link]()!

_or_ you can compile the code from source like a chad; however it is more time consuming and talking clear, you won't contribute to anything if you create your own version of the bot

### Contributing

If you are an _hackerman 0x07 "I will leak ur IP address"_ type of guy and you wanna contribute to the project, simply open a pull request with your changes and we will listen to your feedback or even implement it as we go on!
Be sure to make brainfull requests doe: we don't want any kids spamming "I found [the mainframe of the bot](http://127.0.0.1) !1111!1!!!"
